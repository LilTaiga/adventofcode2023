# Advent of Code 2023
This is my first attempt at AoC. \
This repository holds my attempted solutions in Rust to the problems of [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023). \
Feel free to look around.

## Running the solutions
From this folder, execute the command \
`cargo run --bin dayX` \
to run the solution from day `X`.

Or you can run \
`cargo test --bin dayX` \
To run the examples for that day.
